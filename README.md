## Personal-Projects

A selection of the work I've been doing recently. Includes finished pieces of research/projects along with the underlying code.

This is currently a work in progress.

1. Options

    This is a selection of the code that I wrote for my MSc. Finance & Economics thesis: 'Option Pricing and Hedging in the Presence of Jumps' in June 2024.

    This has since been updated and continuously improved for my own use.

    It contains algorithms for:
    - Simulating stochastic processes - approximations of continuous processes & tree processes.
    - Exact options pricing for Black-Scholes and Merton Jump Diffusion Models; Tree methods for binomial model; and Monte Carlo methods for simulated processes.
    - Simulating delta-hedging and alternative trading strategies in various modelling environments. Analysis of strategies, quantifying PnL distributions, etc.
