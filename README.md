## Personal-Projects

A selection of the work I've been doing recently. Includes finished pieces of research/projects along with the underlying code.

This is currently a work in progress.

1. Options

    This is a selection of the code that I wrote for my MSc. Finance & Economics thesis: 'Option Pricing and Hedging in the Presence of Jumps' in June 2024.

    This has since been significantly updated and continuously improved for my own use.

    It contains algorithms for:
    - Simulating stochastic processes - approximations of continuous processes & tree processes.
    - Exact options pricing for Black-Scholes and Merton Jump Diffusion Models; Tree methods for binomial model; and Monte Carlo methods for simulated processes.
    - Simulating delta-hedging and alternative trading strategies in various modelling environments. Analysis of strategies, quantifying PnL distributions, etc.
    
2. UK Polling

    Project seeking to identify how voters flow between parties between election dates. Used polling data for UK general election voter intention to decompose such flows.

    Contains programs and algorithms for:
    - Importing & cleaning of polling data indicating voter support for main political parties along with visualisations.
    - Applying appropriate smoothing and processing of data into usable form for estimating voter support on any given day and for Markov chain model estimation.
    - Estimating a time-varying Markov chain model to reveal transition probabilities between parties by Elastic Net regularisation and performing model selection & evaluation over hyperparameters.
